# OIDC
Open ID Connect
OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework. It allows third-party applications to verify the identity of the end-user and to obtain basic user profile information. OIDC uses JSON web tokens (JWTs), 


JWTs contain claims, which are statements (such as name or email address) about an entity (typically, the user) and additional metadata. The OpenID Connect specification defines a set of standard claims. The set of standard claims include name, email, gender, birth date, and so on. However, if you want to capture information about a user and there currently isn't a standard claim that best reflects this piece of information, you can create custom claims and add them to your tokens.
